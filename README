This is a new app we're all making!  Carrots and chocholate for everyone!

HOW TO START
run the Hangman.sh script with
'source Hangman.sh'
or go into src directory and run
'python hangman_controller.py'

We want to be following the MVC design pattern.  That's Model, View, Controller. 
Model is the database backend.  It's where all tough computations take place.  
View is the user interface.  It should be extrememly dumb and pass all it's work 
to the Controller.  The Controller is a middle-man between the Model and the View.  
It should listen for events in the View (user interface) and in response perform
logic and invoke functions of the View or Model.  It's like the Genie between
Aladdin and Jasmine:  he can connect the two in love, but only if you ask.
